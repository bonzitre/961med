<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Welcome to the 961st Health Readiness Database. This database automatically locks controls in Access while using it to prevent unwanted changes.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you can see above, there is a top row of buttons "HOME", "Coming Due", "OVERDUE", "DRC3", "All Soldiers", and "Export". Below each of them are another row of buttons that change depending on the selected tab. For this tab, HOME, there are the sub-tabs "Welcome" (what you are reading now) and "How-To".</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The important are "Coming Due", "Overdue", and "DRC3". Coming due is within 90 days (and able to schedule now) and Overdue is over 365 days+ since thier last exam. Under the Coming and Overdue tabs there are sub tabs. They are "BOTH", "PHA", and "DENTAL". If they are under the BOTH tab that means that both PHA and Dental fall under that category. Those soldiers under DRC3 are DRC3, regardless of any dates.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The last tab, "ALL SOLDIERS" has ALL SOLDIERS in the BN so that if someone has a question or you want to know their last PHA or Dental date or DRC, go there. You can also review all your soldiers to ensure their contact information is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This database will be updated at least every Monday morning to update soldiers who are added to the BN and to update PHA and Dental dates as well as DRC. There is still a lot to be done but this should get us started with being able to track on the BN level so that we can justify numbers and provide comments when asked. See the next tab above to get information on the datafields on each tab!</p>
